# Austin Mckee - Periodic Tables

This is My Thinkful Capstone Project. This project is a PERN-Stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Node. js.) application that represents a Reservation System for a restaurant called Periodic Tables. This application gives users the ability to create/edit reservations, seat a reservation at a table, create tables, and search for a reservation by phone number.

# React Application

## `/dashboard` And `/dashboard?date=YYYY-MM-DD` - Home Page

This page displays the reservations for a specific date that aren't `completed` or `cancelled` as well as displaying all tables. The default date if no date is given is the current date.
### insert `screenshot` here

## `/search`
This page allows the user to search for a reservation by phone number either partial or full phone number then shows a list of matching reservations.
### insert before search `screenshot`

### insert after search `screenshot`

## `reservations/new`
This route displays a form that allows the user to create a new reservation.
